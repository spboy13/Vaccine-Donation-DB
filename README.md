# Vaccine-Donation-DB
Sample python implementation of vaccine donation entries database. Created as part of UPD EEE121 Probset requirements.

WARNING: Don't use the code itself for real-life DB application.The program is for learning purposes only. 
It DOES NOT create a DB file and so once the user exits the program, ALL DATA WILL BE LOST. 

The program will be helpful only for those who are studying Data Structures and ADTs (Abstract Data Types).

Of course, if one is to use the implementation in order to create a feasible application, 
he/she can contact me at: arthurbetezjr@gmail.com.
